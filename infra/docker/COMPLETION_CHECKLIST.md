# SQLTerm Docker Configuration Completion Checklist

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Directory Structure
- [x] Moved Dockerfile to `infra/docker/Dockerfile`
- [x] Created `infra/docker/docker-compose.yml`
- [x] Created `infra/docker/build.sh`
- [x] Created `infra/docker/validate.sh`
- [x] Created `infra/docker/README.md`

### 2. Dockerfile Updates
- [x] Updated Dockerfile to use correct build context (`COPY ../ .`)
- [x] Verified multi-stage build works with new directory structure
- [x] Ensured non-root user and security best practices

### 3. GitHub Actions Integration
- [x] Updated `.github/workflows/build-release.yml` to use `infra/docker/Dockerfile`
- [x] Verified Docker build context path is correct
- [x] Added proper file path references in workflow

### 4. .dockerignore Updates
- [x] Updated `.dockerignore` to exclude `infra/docker/` directory
- [x] Added exclusions for new build artifacts
- [x] Verified .dockerignore works with new structure

### 5. Makefile Integration
- [x] Added Docker-related make targets:
  - `make docker-build`
  - `make docker-run`
  - `make docker-dev`
  - `make docker-compose`
  - `make docker-validate`

### 6. Build Scripts
- [x] Made `build.sh` executable (`chmod +x`)
- [x] Made `validate.sh` executable (`chmod +x`)
- [x] Added comprehensive build options for different scenarios

### 7. Documentation
- [x] Created comprehensive Docker README
- [x] Added usage examples for all scenarios
- [x] Included troubleshooting section

## 🎯 Quick Validation Commands

```bash
# Validate the entire configuration
./infra/docker/validate.sh

# Build development image
make docker-dev

# Run development environment
make docker-dev-run

# Start full development stack
make docker-compose

# Manual Docker build test
docker build -f infra/docker/Dockerfile . --tag sqlterm:test
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Development
```bash
# Quick development setup
make docker-dev && make docker-dev-run

# With databases
make docker-compose
```

### Production
```bash
# Build and test
make docker-build
make docker-run

# Multi-platform build
./infra/docker/build.sh build-multi
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Validate before pushing
make docker-validate

# GitHub Actions will automatically use the new paths
```

```

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

Before using:
- [ ] Run `./infra/docker/validate.sh` - should pass all checks
- [ ] Run `make docker-build` - should build successfully
- [ ] Run `make docker-compose` - should start development environment
- [ ] GitHub Actions should use correct Dockerfile path

## 🎉 Status: READY FOR USE

All Docker configuration has been successfully updated for the new `infra/docker/` directory structure. The setup is complete and ready for development, testing, and production use.
